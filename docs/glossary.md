# Glossary

**ucrUsage**

The Ucr consumption of the contract caller in one contract trigger.

**ucrFee**

The number of STB burned from the contract caller for Ucr consumption in one contract trigger.

**originUcrUsage**

The total Ucr consumption of the contract developer in one contract trigger.

**ucrUsageTotal**

The total Ucr consumption of the contract developer and the contract caller combined.

**Feelimit**

When the user triggers or create the contract, this is used to set the usage limit of the Ucr consumption got from burning STB or staking STB, Ucr got from staking STB will be used first.

**CallValue**

When the user triggers or create the contract, this can be used to send STB to the contract.

**consume_user_resource_percent**

For a contract, Resource consumption is composed of two parts, one part is afforded by contract developer and the other part is afforded by contract caller. This is the percentage of the two parts in the Resource consumption.

**origin_ucr_limit**

The usage limit of the Ucr consumption of the developer in one  contract trigger, should be greater than 0.

**net_usage**

The Bandwidth consumption in one contract trigger.  (NetFee not included)

**net_fee**

The STB burned for Bandwidth consumption in one contract trigger.

**Bandwidth**

The Bandwidth Points consumed by a transaction is the size of the byte array in this transaction. If the byte array length of a transaction is 100, then the transaction needs to consume 100 Bandwidth Points.

**Ucr**

The creation and operation of a smart contract consume CPU resources. It takes time for smart contracts to operate in virtual machines (VMs), and the time consumed in the system is calculated in microseconds. CPU resources are consumed in ucr, which means 1 Ucr = 1 Microsecond (μs). If a contract takes 100 μs to execute in a VM, it needs to consume 100 Ucr.

**STABILA Power(TP)**

1 staked STB = 1 TP, TP can be used to vote, 1 TP = 1 vote.

**Super Representative(SR)**

The current block producing Top 21 nodes.
